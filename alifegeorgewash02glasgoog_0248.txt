nortl Carolina Collega.

Dran Sta-1 haveat your request pemsed a portion

free from faults, it shows a most unoommon acquaint-

in Latin composition. I have no hesitation in saying‚
that in the hands of an accurate toacher it will make a

pleasing and useful school-book.

and Tarqnin, an Augustus and Nero, with a prospect of

advenced studentes well as the man of literary leisure,
