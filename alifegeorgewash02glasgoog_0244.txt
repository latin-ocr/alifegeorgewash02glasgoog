I aava eramined with some attention the sheets oi a
Life of Washington, in Latin, by Francis Glass,‘A. M..
andI consider the worlr a perforr‘n‘ance oi no small merit.
In regerd to the style of composition, the² writer has suc-
ceeded far beyond the ordinary efforts at writing in Latin.
'The idione is remarkably pure, the words being selected
with careful attention to precision and classic use. The
barbarisms which the introductiones modern institutions
and observances, particularly the science of war, and
legislation, must necessarily compal the writer 'to use,
are so skiliully reduced to the forms of Roman decien-
sion, that they are' not, in general, offensive. Manyof
them are words exceadingly sonorous and descriptiva.
Another difficulty of no small importance iu writing Lat·

circumstance, that of the numerous classes oi'words
which our language has borrowed from that, the greater
portiones thern have now a meaning different from the
original; and the use oi these words in the same sense
which is annexed, to the analogous English terius,would
be a barbarous perversiou oi their mearung,.offensive to
purity and good teste. In avoiding these, the writer oi
this work shows accurate and faithful training. But he
has not merely freedonr from faults; he possessos posi·
tive excellences. In his periodo, he has generally the
flow and graceful variety which are the principal charin
of the style of history, exhibiting much of ancient digni·
ty and simplicity, aud occasionally turning them with un·
common elegance. In description he is not deficient in
strength and energy, but is easy, and sufficientlydiffuse
to avoid the meagerness of a mere annalist. The life ol
the venerated Father of our Oountry, a character- so suil
of moral and intellectual grandem, can be delineated in
no so appropriate diction as in the severe and majestic
simplicity oi the Roman. And the you'thful sordent or'
classic enthusiasm will find the history of his heloved
country iuvested with a charming interest, when he meets
