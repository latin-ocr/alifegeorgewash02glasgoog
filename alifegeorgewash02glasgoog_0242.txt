Ar the request os Mr. Reynolds,1 have examined the
manuscriptos a Latin Biography of Washington, by the
late Mr. illesa, os Ohio, end consider it well worthy of
publication. Itis, indeed, quite a curiosity of its kind.
There is generally an air os stiffuess in the productione
os modern Latinists, which soon betrays a want of fa·
miliarity, on the partos the writer, with the idiom em·
ployed by him. Nothing of this nature is to be discov-
ered in the present work; on the contrary, the most cur·
sory render cannot fail to be struck with the easy how
of the style, and the graceful turn of very many os the peri-
ods. The care, too, which has been exercised in the se-
lection of appropriate terme and phrases is worthy oi
notice, especially when taken in connexion with the fact
os the author’s having written his work without the aid
of any books of reference, and his having been compel-
led‚ consequently, to roly solely on the stores of his own
memory. 1 would not wish to be understood as viswing
this productiori in the light os an accurately critical and
finished piece, but yet 1 cannot help thinking thet it will
make a very good school-book. For the subject will in·
terest the young scholar, and awaken the best feelings in
his bosom; while, if the Latinity of the work should at
any time appear to the instructer of a questionable or er-
roneous character, he can consult the improvement os
his pupils, and at the sometime display his own acumen,
in suggesting other and better expressions.
