Mn. Ruruouus,

Sin—Accept my thanks sorthe copy of “the Life os
Georgo Weshiugton, in Latin prose.'’ 1 ern much pleas-
ed with both the plan ond tlte execution of the work.
While our youth ure called upon, in many instances to
study elementary books iu our primery schools, oomposed
confessedly by modern scholare, on subjects of compor-
atively minor importance‚ why should they not be fur·
nished with elementary books sor their earlier course,
adopted to furnish a knowledge of our own history, ond
especially of the lise os one whom Amorion, end I moy
say also Europe, is proud to honour.

With my best wishes for your success in endeavouring
to introduce the work into our primury schoole‚

1 eru, door sir, yours,dtc.
