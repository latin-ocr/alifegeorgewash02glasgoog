Mn. Rationes,

Dein Sin-In complianoe with your requeetrl have
examinod “A Life ol Waehington, in Latin Proeto, by
Francis Gletes, A. M„ of 0hio.” My opinion os thie per·
sormanoe is, that in purity of style, rotundity of period,
and judicious' selection of words, it is exoeeded by none
os the modern works introductory, to the study os the
ancient Romanolossics. Ite imperfectione are sow; ite
beauties numerous. It will be a valnable acquisition to
our clossioal schools‚ initiatory to Caesar or Nepos, or
such first Roman author as the toacher may see oense to
adopt. Such an American book⁴ hae hitherto been a ‹le-
sideratum. lt is now furnished. It is well calculated
to lire the youthful genius, and inspiro the generous mind
with the purest patriotic sentiments. Ι ’

'ln thus expressing myself, I cannot ¹help mingling
some feeling with my recollectione of tho author. Iwas
acquainted with Mr. Glass from his boyish days. He
was an enthusi'ostio votary of the classic muse immedi-
ately on his initiation' into the Graminer Sohool. That
he laboured not in vain, thie· productiori will be a lasting
memorial. , “

Very respectfully, poure, διο,
’ S. B. WYLIE.
