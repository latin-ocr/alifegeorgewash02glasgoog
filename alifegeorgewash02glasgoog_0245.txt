Ι am satisfied that this work, stom the excellence oi
its style, and its rich materiale of biography and history,
will become a popular and valuable elementary book in
our schools. Severe criticism may deteot some “ Pate·-

it was written, I consider itan extraordinary productiori.

I shall immediately adopt it as a class-book.

sor os Aneieat Languages ond Literuture of tlte Gol-
lege ⁰s Neu-Jeme.

Tur Life of Washington, by Francis Glaes, is, in the
opinion of the subscribet, awork of singular merit, and of
that degree of excellence which is claimed for it by th'e
editor ; who, by its publication, has discharged a just debt
οἱ gratitude to his able preceptor.

An unqualified approval is not claimed sor the work,
nor is it the designes the subscribet to give it such a
one. His engagements, during the time it has been in
his hands, have not admitted os hie examining the entire
work, yet he doubts not that a perusal of the whole would
serve only to deepen the favourable impressione already
received.

The handsome manner in which the work is presented
to the public, reflects great credit upon all concerned i'n
its publication.

It is to be hoped that the youth of our country may
become familiar with this productiori oi eripe scholam
end thet they may learn to emulate the author’s ardour in

the study of the ancient classice,
